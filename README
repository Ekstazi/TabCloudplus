Tabcloud

Chrome extension in folder "chrome"

Service from Google App Engine reuses the original author's service.

Save, restore and track window sessions over time and across multiple computers.
This extension is based on the TabCloud extension, with one feature added, window/session tracking.
1) when open an already saved window, the newly opened local window will automatically track this saved window. Any tabs added/deleted in this new window will be saved to the same saved window when click the "save" button.
2) when open a new window locally and save this window, this window will automatically track the saved window, i.e. any future changes in this window will be reflected in the saved window after a click on save.

Coming feature:
1) window update. to support window update if a saved window is updated on another machine, it's desirable to sync it with current locally window.

This work is based on the original TabCloud extension, so your exisiting saved windows is persisted. 

This work is mainly for my own need. So intensive testing was done, please use it with caution.

Many thanks to the original author Connor Dunn for his great work!
